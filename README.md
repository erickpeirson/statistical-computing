# Course notes for STA578

These are my notes from STA578, in the form of [iPython notebooks](ipython.org).
I'm doing my best to recreate the example R scripts in Python. This may fail
miserably if I get lost in the stats.

* [Chapter 1 - MCMC](https://github.com/erickpeirson/statistical-computing/blob/master/Chapter%201%20-%20Markov%20Chain%20Monte%20Carlo.ipynb)

You can view the rendered notebooks
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/erickpeirson/statistical-computing/tree/master/).
To run the notebooks: clone this repository, spin up the iPython notebook
server, and load the notebook of your choice.

[Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is a good option if you
have not already installed iPython. It includes [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/),
[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/), and
various other libraries that are helpful for math-y stats-y kinds of things.

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) are
welcome.
